### Nested Schema for `ws_trust.token_generator_mappings.issuance_criteria.conditional_criteria.source`

Required:

- `type` (String) A key that is meant to reference a source from which an attribute can be retrieved. This model is usually paired with a value which, depending on the SourceType, can be a hardcoded value or a reference to an attribute name specific to that SourceType. Not all values are applicable - a validation error will be returned for incorrect values.

- `schema` (String) Lists the table structure that stores information within a database. Some databases, such as Oracle, require a schema for a JDBC query. Other databases, such as MySQL, do not require a schema.
